The CSS property `calc()` can sometimes lead to unexpected results if used incorrectly with units. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue is the lack of specificity when using multiple selectors with the same properties. This can create conflicts and make it hard to debug the styles.  Finally, forgetting to include vendor prefixes for newer CSS properties can cause the styles to not render in older browsers.
