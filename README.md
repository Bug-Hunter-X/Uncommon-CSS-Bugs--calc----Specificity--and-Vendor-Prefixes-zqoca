# Uncommon CSS Bugs and Solutions

This repository demonstrates and provides solutions for three uncommon CSS bugs:

1. **Incorrect use of `calc()`:** The `calc()` function can produce unexpected results if used with relative units and parent elements without a defined size.
2. **Specificity issues:** Multiple CSS selectors with similar properties can create conflicts and make debugging challenging.
3. **Missing vendor prefixes:** New CSS features sometimes require vendor prefixes for compatibility with older browsers. 

The `bug.css` file showcases these issues, while `bugSolution.css` demonstrates the solutions.
